Small example. [demo](jotai-modal-example.vercel.app)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Known possible improvements

- Modals could be prefetched if a button to open it is detected

## Notes

NO, I WON'T USE BUN (i'm talking to you @Byevenes).

Also part of the code is based on a medium post but I can't find it again.
